### RESEARCH:

#### Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects multiple systems in the body and is characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations and variable progression. Its etiology is still not fully understood, although it is recognized that the interaction between genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors plays a key role in its development

SLE is more prevalent in women, particularly between the ages of 15 and 45, and
the role of the X chromosome in the pathogenesis of the disease has attracted
increasing interest.<br>
Genetic factors play a significant role in the development of the disease, making their
study essential for understanding its pathogenesis. My goal is to explore the
relationship between genetic factors associated with the onset of lupus and their
potential association with viral infections, particularly EBV, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV.


Through the analysis and comparison of diverse **datasets**,  my objective is __to identify the genes with the most significant correlation __.
